Explanation 
- Sum(sales) - Adds sales values
- Over() - Turns it into a window function.
- PARTITION BY productid - Groups rows by each product.
- it calculates total sales per product without collapsing rows

- Sum(sales) over(partition by productid) - Calculates total sales for each product
- Partition by productid - Groups rows logically by product.
- The window function does not collapse rows */

Explanation
- Where productid in (101,102) - filters the data to include only products 101 and 102
- SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY orderstatus) - Calculates the total sales for each orderstatus
- Partition by orderstatus - Groups the calculation by order status without collapsig rows.
- The query keeps all individual rows and displays the total slaes per status alongside each row

Explanation
- Group by customerid - combines all orders belonging to the same customer
- SUM(sales) - calculates each customer's total sales
- Rank() over(order by sum(sales) desc) - Ranks customers from highest to lowest total sales.
If two customers have the same total sales, they receive the same rank, and the next rank is skipped*/
